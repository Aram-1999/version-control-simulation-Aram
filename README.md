### The steps you took to create and manage branches.
To create branches, I used `git checkout -b <branch name>`. This command creates a new branch and 
then changes the current branch to it. After making changes to the repository, I committed those changes to the feature branches
created previously. After I finished working on that feature, I switched to the main branch using the `git checkout <branch>` command.
I followed this process until all the features were created as specified in the assignment.

### How you handled the merge conflict.
I handled merge conflicts by manually fixing the files. After fixing the conflicts, I staged the modified files and made a resolution
commit.
